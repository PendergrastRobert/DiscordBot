# DiscordBot
A bot for Discord

This bot currently has a few basic functions, all of which can be called from the '!' key, followed by the command words.
These commands are as follows:

	!ping : Test to respond to the user with 'Pong!'
	!fortune : A question must be asked, ending with a '?' which will respond with a 'Yes', 'No', etc.
	!coinflip : Responds with a 'Heads' or 'Tails'
	!roll : Rolls a dice and totals the amount. The format is 'Number of Dice'd'Sides of Dice' ex. !roll 1d6 would roll a single 6-sided dice
